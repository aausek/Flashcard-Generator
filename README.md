# Flashcard-Generator

### Clone the repo in order to run the `app.js` file and `npm install` to ensure you have the correct packages to execute the application.

### This application allows the user to create basic and cloze-deleted flashcards using node.js

### Basic flashcards are displayed using the following the format:

 1. **Basic** flashcards, which have a front (_"Who was the first president of the United States?"_), and a back (_"George Washington"_).

### A flash card built in the cloze-deleted fashion has three parts:

 1. The full text. This is the entire sentence users need to remember: "George Washington was the first president of the United States."

 2. The cloze deletion. This is the text we've chosen to remove: "George Washington".

 3. The partial text. This is what we get if we remove the cloze deletion from the full text: "... was the first president of the United States.

### The game also keeps score of questions answered, correct & incorrect answers.

## Enjoy the game!

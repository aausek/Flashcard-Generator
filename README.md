# Flashcard-Generator

### This application allows the user to create basic and cloze-deleted flashcards using.

### A flash card built in the cloze-deleted fashion has three parts:

### The full text. This is the entire sentence users need to remember: "George Washington was the first president of the United States."

### The cloze deletion. This is the text we've chosen to remove: "George Washington".

### The partial text. This is what we get if we remove the cloze deletion from the full text: "... was the first president of the United States.
